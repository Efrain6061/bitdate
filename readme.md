# BitDate

BitDate is a small Tinder clone for Android.

It uses Parse for the backend to store users, uses Facebook Sign-in to register users, and uses Firebase for realtime chat communication between users. 

It also has a Tinder-esque UI as well including the motion gestures to like and dislike users. Also learned how to use Viewpager, DrawerLayout and Fragments while building this project.
